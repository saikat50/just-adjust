                                Injuries at work can occur suddenly, such as a slip or fall, or slowly over time with repetitive strain on an area of the body. Overtime, small tasks done with poor posture can lead to acute and chronic pain, which can result in reduced worker productivity, lost time from work, disability, and an inability to perform job tasks. If you are injured at work and need a quick adjustment then we are the perfect fit for you.
