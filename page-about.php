                I  have noticed over the years the complaints of chiropractic patients. These include among many:
                <br>
                <br>

            <ul class="points">
                <li><p><span>1)</span> "the chiropractor wants me to come in 3 times a week for 6 months" (studies have been done that conclude there is no change in cervical lordosis (neck curvature) after a series of adjustments),</p></li>
                <li><p><span>2)</span> "I was referred to a lending institution to pay in advance for my year's worth of treatment" ($25 cash payment with no pressure to come back),</p></li>
                <li><p><span>3)</span> "I get treated also with muscle stimulation, but I'm not sure if it even helps and then I am charged for it." (no frills, no lotions, no potions, just adjustments),</p></li>
                <li><p><span>4)</span> "I went to my chiropractor and my insurance was charged $285!" (there are so many physicians taking advantage of the insurances. Not here. A treatment is $25; no more. ) And the list goes on. </p></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="regular-para-20 color-gray mt-4">As far back as I can remember, I experienced headaches that would last 2-3 days and a few times a month. My parents would take me to the doctor many times and was given many prescriptions. Finally, at age 19, I saw my first chiropractor. The pain went away with one adjustment! Now, when a headache arises, an adjustment takes care of it. The doctor told me that there must have been some type of trauma when I was young. I inquired my parents. It turns out, I was in my mother's arms at 2 years old when we were in a head-on collision with a dump truck. (there were no child restraint laws back then) It had to be this accident. The experience with the chiropractor sparked my interest to the point that I went back to school and eventually graduated from, at the time, Parker College of Chiropractic in 1996. </p>

            <h3 class="about-head color-green mt-6">About Dr. Albright</h3>
            <p class="regular-para-20 color-gray mt-4">I was born at Yale-New Haven Hospital and lived in a suburb of Bridgeport, Connecticut, until I was 5. My parents then moved to Bozrah, Connecticut, which has the distinction of being the only town in the world named such. The local high school was Norwich Free Academy where I graduated from in 1984. I attended Brigham Young University where I first majored in English and minored in Greek and Roman Mythology. That changed when, at 25, I decided to go to chiropractic school and then had to get caught up on the science courses.
                <br>
                <br>
                I married a wonderful girl, Christine, and have 6 wonderful children.
                <br>
                <br>
                I currently teach at Dixie State University as adjunct faculty in a gross anatomy lab setting. Students range from pre-nursing to pre-med. One of my nerdy dreams is to get a math degree and I am currently taking upper calculus and math courses on my way there.
